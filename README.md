# Adventurers' Table
Tabletop RPG environment for HTC Vive

Adventurers' Table is a multiplayer environment designed to facilitate tabletop roleplaying in VR. 

TODOs: 
- PDF importing to clipboard
- Replace multiplayer engine with something that works
- Replace placeholder minis and graphics with lovely custom art
- See the [TRELLO](https://trello.com/b/FqNI2Rf2/adventurers-table) for a million more tasks

WARNING: This is a work in progress. Lots of things are broken or in progress, but will be fixed in time. Most of the interactable objects such as the orc mini are meant as placeholders until we get better custom art.
